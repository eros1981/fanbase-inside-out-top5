# Slack Bot Crash Fix

## Problem Description

The Slack bot was experiencing recurring crashes with the error:

```
Error: Unhandled event 'server explicit disconnect' in state 'connecting'.
```

This error occurred in the Slack Socket Mode client's state machine, specifically in the `finity` library that handles WebSocket connection states. The crashes were happening during network disconnections when the bot was in the "connecting" state.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Socket Mode Connection Issues**: The bot uses Slack's Socket Mode (WebSocket) for real-time communication, which can be unstable in production environments
2. **Missing Error Handling**: The original implementation lacked comprehensive error handling for uncaught exceptions and unhandled rejections
3. **No Reconnection Logic**: There was no automatic reconnection mechanism when the WebSocket connection was lost
4. **Outdated Framework**: The Slack Bolt framework version was not the latest, missing recent stability improvements

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Socket Mode Configuration

- Added `socketModeOptions` with automatic reconnection enabled
- Implemented exponential backoff for reconnection attempts
- Set unlimited reconnection attempts with intelligent delays

### 2. Comprehensive Error Handling

- Added handlers for `uncaughtException` and `unhandledRejection`
- Implemented graceful shutdown procedures
- Added signal handlers for `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`

### 3. Health Monitoring System

- Created a comprehensive health monitoring utility (`health-monitor.ts`)
- Added periodic health checks every 30 seconds
- Implemented status tracking for Socket Mode connections
- Added memory usage monitoring

### 4. Enhanced Logging and Monitoring

- Added Socket Mode event listeners for disconnect/reconnect/error events
- Implemented detailed logging for connection status changes
- Added health status reporting

### 5. New Health Check Command

- Added `/health` command for real-time bot status monitoring
- Provides comprehensive health report including uptime, memory usage, and connection status

### 6. Framework Updates

- Updated Slack Bolt framework to latest version (3.18.0)
- Ensured compatibility with latest stability improvements

## Files Modified

### Core Application (`src/index.ts`)

- Enhanced App initialization with Socket Mode options
- Added comprehensive error handling and process management
- Integrated health monitoring system
- Added `/health` command handler

### New Health Monitor (`src/utils/health-monitor.ts`)

- Comprehensive health monitoring utility
- Status tracking and reporting
- Memory usage monitoring
- Connection status management

### Package Configuration (`package.json`)

- Updated Slack Bolt framework to latest version
- Maintained compatibility with existing dependencies

### Deployment Script (`deploy-fix.sh`)

- Automated deployment script for the fix
- Build verification and deployment preparation

## Key Features Added

### Automatic Reconnection

```typescript
socketModeOptions: {
  autoReconnectEnabled: true,
  maxReconnectAttempts: 0, // Unlimited
  reconnectInterval: 1000,
  maxReconnectInterval: 30000,
  reconnectDecay: 1.5,
}
```

### Health Monitoring

- Real-time status monitoring
- Memory usage tracking
- Connection status reporting
- Error logging and tracking

### Graceful Shutdown

- Proper cleanup on termination signals
- Health status logging before shutdown
- Resource cleanup

## Usage

### Deploying the Fix

1. Run the deployment script:

   ```bash
   ./deploy-fix.sh
   ```

2. Deploy the updated code to your hosting platform

3. Monitor the logs for improved stability

### Monitoring Bot Health

- Use the `/health` command in Slack to check bot status
- Monitor application logs for health check reports
- Watch for automatic reconnection messages

### Expected Behavior

- Bot will automatically reconnect on disconnections
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging
- Graceful handling of network issues
- No more crashes due to unhandled Socket Mode events

## Monitoring and Alerts

The health monitoring system provides:

- **Status Levels**: Healthy, Degraded, Unhealthy
- **Metrics**: Uptime, Memory Usage, Connection Status
- **Alerts**: Automatic logging of health issues
- **Reports**: Detailed health reports via `/health` command

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Connection Testing**: Test bot behavior during network interruptions
2. **Load Testing**: Verify stability under high message volume
3. **Health Monitoring**: Use `/health` command to verify monitoring works
4. **Error Handling**: Test graceful shutdown procedures

## Future Improvements

1. **Metrics Collection**: Add external metrics collection (e.g., Prometheus)
2. **Alerting**: Implement external alerting for unhealthy status
3. **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize memory usage
4. **Backup Connection**: Consider implementing HTTP mode as fallback

## Support

If issues persist after this fix:

1. Check the health status using `/health` command
2. Review application logs for detailed error information
3. Verify environment variables are correctly set
4. Ensure hosting platform supports WebSocket connections
